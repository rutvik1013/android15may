Being an auto-generated file that is generated by AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool), Android R.java contains resource IDs for all the resources of res/ directory. The id for the created component is automatically generated in the R.java whenever a component is created in the android activity_main.xml file. The life cycle methods for an activity such as onCreate, onStop, OnResume, etc is provided by the Activity java class. The created ID can later be used in the Java Source file. To act on a component, the corresponding id can be used in the activity source file. The android creates the R.jar file automatically in case the R.jar file is deleted. The android R.java file contains many static nested classes such as menu, id, layout, attr, drawable, string, etc.
